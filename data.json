On the ends of each of these five strands is a bell-shaped, four-lobed bead.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nFollowing the sensational discovery of the tomb of King Tutankhamun in 1922, there was an &ldquo;Egyptomania&rdquo; craze that inspired everything from architectural design to fashion. &nbsp;Many travelers returned from Egypt with souvenir beads which were made into necklaces such as these examples that were likely re-strung in the 1920s mimicking Egyptian style.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nTiny beads like these are most often found in a lump on the chest of mummies. With the linking strings rotted away, it is not possible to determine their original design. Seldom are tiny beads of this type found in their original configuration on necklaces. The beads indicate the richness of their owner and were personal possessions that were used in burial. They could be made of gold, glass, carnelian, hematite, faience or semi-precious stones.",
